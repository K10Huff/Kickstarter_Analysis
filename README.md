# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
The following excel workbook contains a statistical analysis of Kickstarter trends for 
campaigns launched from 2011-2017. Specifically focusing on the subcategory *Plays* under 
the *Theater* parent category, charts and graphs were created to determine when to launch 
the fundraiser and what the realistic goals of the campaign should be.

Based on the data, there are more successful Kickstarters launched in May or June. 
Additionally, the average goal of the successful campaign was around $3,000 (with around 
$3,000 eventually pledged.)
